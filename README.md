## 💾 How Storage Works

TimeVault uses a **local-first** architecture. All data lives in the browser's `localStorage` under a single key: `timevault_data`.

### What's Stored

| Data | Description | Persistence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `settings` | Hourly rate, overtime config, currency, time format | Until cleared |
| `timeEntries` | Array of all clock in/out sessions with earnings | Until cleared |
| `aiMemory` | Conversation history (last 50 messages) | Until cleared |
| `aiConfig` | Ollama URLs, model selection, voice preferences | Until cleared |
| `syncData` | Email/PIN for sync, last sync timestamp | Until cleared |
| `isWorking` | Whether user is currently clocked in | Until cleared |
| `sessionStart` | Timestamp of current active session | Until cleared |

### Storage Limits

- **localStorage**: ~5–10 MB per origin (browser-dependent)
- **Each time entry**: ~150–200 bytes
- **At 5 entries/week**: ~4.5 KB/month — storage won't fill for years
- **Storage indicator**: Visible in Settings → About section

### Service Worker Cache

The Service Worker (`sw.js`) caches all app assets for offline use:

- **Local assets**: Cache-first with background refresh (stale-while-revalidate)
- **CDN resources**: Network-first with cache fallback
- **Navigation**: Network-first, falls back to cached `index.html`

### Data Management

- **Export**: Download all data as a timestamped JSON backup file
- **Import**: Restore from a previously exported JSON file
- **Clear**: Permanently delete all data and reset to defaults

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TechGuruServices/TIMEVAULT-V2.git
   cd TIMEVAULT-V2
   ```

2. Serve with any static file server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8080

   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .

   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

> **Note**: Service Workers require HTTP(S) — they won't register from `file://` protocol. Use a local server for full PWA functionality.

### Install as PWA

1. Open the app in Chrome, Edge, or Safari
2. Click the install prompt or use the browser menu → "Install App" / "Add to Home Screen"
3. TimeVault will run as a standalone app with its own window

### AI Assistant Setup (Optional)

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your machine
2. Pull a model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```

3. Start Ollama:

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

4. In TimeVault Settings → AI Configuration:
   - Enable Ollama AI
   - Set Local URL to `http://localhost:11434`
   - Select your model
   - Click "Test Connection"

For remote access (e.g., from a phone on the same network), set the Remote URL to your machine's IP address.
